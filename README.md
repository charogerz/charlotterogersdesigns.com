Hi! My name is Charlotte Rogers, I'm a UI designer and an MFA Design and Technology student studying at Parsons School of Design in NYC, and this is my personal portfolio page.

Special thanks to ndoherty-xyz for the great template starting point as I further my own coding skills. I felt it was important for me to build and host this site myself, but this made the process of personalizing so much faster!
