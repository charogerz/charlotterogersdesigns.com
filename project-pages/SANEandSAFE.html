          <div class="body-text">This project focused on the forensic medical exam experience for survivors in North Carolina and how I could create a tool that might help to make that process less retraumatizing and more accessible. I aimed to create a toolkit that was easy to understand, comprehensive, not biased toward any particular choice, and was more engaging than existing resources, such as medical brochures. This was a very research heavy project that I only had the semester to complete, so the form that it ultimately took was one that fit within my specified criteria and constraints.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The final product, pictured above and below, is a zine that passed many variations but was ultimately designed using Procreate and Adobe Illustrator and was printed on newsprint for approachability and ease of access offline. An online partner tool is something that I continue to work on in my spare time. You can find my full project paper <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16j_Bsw8PAuaJE3ahnyl2eXMuIok6aQFM/edit">HERE</a> for more information about my process and design choices.</div>
