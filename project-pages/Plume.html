          <div class="body-text">Conceptualized and created alongside my class partner at the time, this project was one where we were tasked with exploring a romantic narrative through a creative medium. We chose to relate to the modern dating experience of using apps, but decided that Greater Birds of Paradise would be our main characters, as their mating ritual is unique to them and would add some intrigue and fun to the project. Viewers are able to work through the narrative from the main character's perspective, working through messages with matches that hit dead ends and messaging the primary love interest themselves after viewing her own profile. See for yourself where the love story ends!</div>
          <div class="body-text">The final product was featured in the Museum of the Moving Image in New York in December of 2023 as part of their Stories in Motion pop-up exhibit.
