          <div class="body-text">I have volunteered at Our Wave since April 2023, helping them completely restructure
            and redesign their newsletter system. Previously, they had been sending out infrequent and long emails for
            all updates. These were off-brand, bulleted lists that did not fully represent who they are as an
            organization and what they wanted to share with partners and their community. I have since been the lead on
            writing and sending these emails out multiple times a month, designing templates first in Figma with their lead Desginer before templating and
            formatting them in the platform Sendgrid. I have mapped out and helped them to create newsletter and subscriber groups
            focusing on partner updates, donation inquiries, monthly blog updates, upcoming events, and impact reports.</div>
